# Kitteh Clickerz!
Click on teh kitteh

This is a game where you click a kitten or cat thus scoring points.

Points are displayed and updated as you play.

This version of Kitteh Clickerz allows you to select the number of kittehs you are currently hoping to click upon. The Pro featureset also provides an Admin console where a kitteh's values may be changed.

## Note:
Kitteh Clickers uses cross-origin requests which may cause problems with your browser resulting in no Kittehs! It may be neccessary to turn off the browser's security for things to work proper-like.

To do this in Chrome (from Terminal):

<code>open -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --disable-web-security &</code>
